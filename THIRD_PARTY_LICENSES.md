## ZLIB

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the

## FFmpeg (Optional)

- **License**: LGPL 2.1+ or GPL (depending on build configuration)
- **Website**: https://ffmpeg.org/
- **Usage**: Invoked as external subprocess for video recording (not linked)

FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard. If FFmpeg is bundled with this
application, its license terms apply to the FFmpeg binary only, not to TAREEK-Vis.
Prebuilt releases bundle the gyan.dev "essentials" build, which includes
GPL-licensed components (e.g. libx264); this is compatible with TAREEK-Vis's
own GPLv3 license. An LGPL-only FFmpeg build may be substituted if a less
restrictive redistribution is needed.

---

## OpenGL

- **Usage**: Graphics rendering via system-provided drivers
- **No licensing restrictions** apply to the use of the OpenGL API.

# Background Map Tile Services

The optional background map layer (View → Background Map) streams raster map
tiles over HTTPS from the third-party services listed below. These tiles are
**not** bundled with or redistributed by TAREEK-Vis; they are requested
directly by the end user's machine when a background layer is enabled, and are
cached only in memory for the duration of the session.

Each service requires attribution whenever its map imagery is displayed,
reproduced, or published. If you publish figures, screenshots, or recorded
videos made with a background map enabled, credit the corresponding provider
in the caption or credits. Use of these services is subject to each
provider's own terms, which may limit commercial or high-volume use.
