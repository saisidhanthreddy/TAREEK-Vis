// Converts our directed MATSim network into the undirected edge graph a density
// computation works on, and places activities along its edges.
//
// Two conversions happen here, and each one can hide a mistake:
//
//  1. MATSim networks are directed and usually hold both A->B and B->A. Network
//     distance is symmetric, so reciprocal pairs merge into one undirected
//     edge. The link that is merged away is the "reversed" one, and any point
//     on it must have its offset flipped to (length - offset).
//
//  2. An activity has a true (x, y). Its offset along the edge comes from
//     projecting that point onto the link segment. We use the link named by the
//     event itself, so no nearest-link search is needed.
